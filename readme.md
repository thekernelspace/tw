## Features
- **All-in-one tree view**: subdirectories and files are shown in a tree format (a la your typical `tree` command). You can expand / collapse subdirectories and get to your file quickly
- **Navigation shortcuts**: navigate to files with quick keybinds; inspired by `vim-easymotion`
- **View session**: directory views are saved for the next time you view them
- **Most recently used files**: files that you have accessed recently are placed conveniently
- **Common files**: files you commonly access are now quickly accessible in the pane
- **Search/filtering**: quickly traverse the directory with filtering
- **Markers**: mark important files to visit later
